// create a function percentage that will receive an array of numbers and return another with 3 numbers: index 0 will be the percentage of positive numbers, index 1 will be the percentage of numbers that are zero and index 2 the percentage of negative numbers.
// i.e: percentage([1, 2, 0, -1]) should return [0.5, 0.25, 0.25], as there are 50% of positive numbers, 25% zeros, and 25% negative numbers.
